# hash_map

yeah so this is a hash map thing i made in ruby

## what is it

its a hash map and hash set implementation. basically stores key-value pairs or just keys

## how to run

```bash
ruby main.rb
```

thats it

## whats in here

- `HashMap` - stores keys and values
- `HashSet` - just stores keys
- uses linked lists for collision handling i guess

## files

- `main.rb` - has some tests or whatever
- `lib/hash_map.rb` - the hash map class
- `lib/hash_set.rb` - the hash set class
- `lib/linked_list.rb` - linked list for collision stuff
- `lib/node.rb` - node for the linked list

idk it works tho
